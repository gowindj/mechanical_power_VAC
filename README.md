the association between mechanical power and ventilator associated condition
Objective: This study aims to investigate the association between mechanical power normalized by predicted weight (MPW) and ventilator-associated condition (VAC) in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). 
Methods: Utilizing COX regression and Bayesian joint model analyses, the correlation between MPW and VAC incidence was estimated in mechanically ventilated patients sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU) spanning the year 2001-2012.
Results: Among a cohort of 14,694 mechanically ventilated individuals, the COX model demonstrated that for each 0.1 J/kg/min increase in MPW from baseline, there was a statistically significant association with an increased incidence of VAC (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.06, p < 0.01). The Bayesian joint model indicated that this effect persisted throughout the entire duration of mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, an elevated MPW at baseline was also significantly linked to higher 28-day mortality (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.04, p = 0.004) and a reduction in ventilator-free days (coefficient -0.17, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.10, p < 0.001).
Conclusion: Increases in mechanical power are associated with the development of a ventilator-associated condition and an increased risk of 28-day mortality. Monitoring and optimizing mechanical power should be an important consideration in the care of critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation.
